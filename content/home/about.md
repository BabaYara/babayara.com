# About

I am a PhD student in Finance studying at NOVA School of Business and Economics. My research interests lie in the intersection of Return Predictability, Machine Learning, and  Financial Econometrics. I am particularly interested in whether or not return predictability at the portfolio level can be improved using tools outside the traditional framework. 

I am currenrtly in the 3rd year of the program and look set to graduate in 2019.
